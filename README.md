- copied code from here <https://gist.github.com/jackcarter/d86808449f0d95060a40#gistcomment-2272461>

- initial gist from here <https://gist.github.com/jackcarter/d86808449f0d95060a40>

- updated code with changes to my preference, file size grater than 0 mb, so deletes all files more than 30 days.


## how to run

- copy the files to your laptop/pc

- get your slack API token >> keep it safe, disable or delete after use <<

- update the local file with your API token and run `python3 slack-api-delete-files.py`

- remove the token from file

- disable/revoke the token from your slack API, create a new token next time you needed it
